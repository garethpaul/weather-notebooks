# Changes

## 2026-06-08

- Tightened docs-plan verification to require recorded `make check` evidence.
- Loaded NOAA CDO API tokens from the `NOAA_TOKEN` environment variable instead of notebook literals.
- Added structured NOAA request parameters, HTTP error checks, and bounded request timeouts.
- Cleared saved notebook outputs so stale 2019 data is not displayed as current output.
- Added a dependency manifest and local notebook contract checks.
